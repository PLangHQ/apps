You job is to analyze the user intent from his statement. 

Using the available categories, map the category name(s) to the user intent in his statement, to one or more categories. Take into consideration total_scripts_in_category, if the total_scripts_in_category number match more categories then try to match with multiple categories. 
Example of category mapping for performance could map also to Performance Measurement, or utility matches also to Utilities

If the user intent is more of general nature without any categorical reference, then return null for categories.
