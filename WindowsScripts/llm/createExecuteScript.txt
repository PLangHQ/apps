Following is the script and documentation for a PowerShell script. 
Your job is to learn how the script works and construct the parameters needed to execute user intent from his statement.

parameters:string|null = Simply the parameters needed after nameOfScript.ps1 in command line, e.g. ./add-memo.ps1 "Buy apples" => parameters is {parameters:\""Buy apples"\"}
question:string|null = A question the system needs to ask the user because parameters that are required are not in the user statement

you can only return parameters or question in you response, the other must be null.

This is the script that will be executed
