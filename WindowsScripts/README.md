# WindowsScript: Natural Language Command Interface for Windows

## Overview

WindowsScript revolutionizes the way you interact with your Windows system by allowing you to execute tasks through natural language commands. 

Drawing from a rich repository of over 600 scripts sourced from [fleschutz's PowerShell GitHub repository](https://github.com/fleschutz/PowerShell), WindowsScript bridges the gap between complex scripting and user-friendly operations, making it easier for users to manage their systems without deep technical knowledge of PowerShell scripts.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing:** Interact with your Windows system using simple, conversational language.
- **Extensive Script Library:** Access to a comprehensive collection of scripts for various tasks, from system diagnostics to application management.
- **Dynamic Script Execution:** The platform intelligently interprets user commands and selects the appropriate script for execution.
- **User-Centric Design:** Designed with the user in mind, WindowsScript simplifies complex system operations through an intuitive interface.

## Usage

### Getting Started

To begin using WindowsScript, ensure you have cloned this repository to your local system. Navigate to the WindowsScript directory in your command prompt and initiate the program by typing `plang`.

### Important Note

> ⚠️ **Warning:** WindowsScript is a powerful tool intended for demonstration and proof of concept. Each request to the system incurs a cost of approximately $0.25 due to the usage of Large Language Models (LLM) for processing natural language commands. Users should proceed with caution and be mindful of the potential costs associated with extensive use.

### How to Use

Upon starting WindowsScript, the application will prompt you with the question, "What would you like to do?" From here, you can engage with the system in various ways:

- **Discover Capabilities:** Ask "What can I do?" to get an overview of the system's capabilities.
- **Explore Categories:** Request a "List of categories" to see the different types of scripts available.
- **Execute Commands:** Input natural language commands for tasks you wish to perform. Examples include:
  - "What users are on the system?"
  - "How is my DNS speed?"
  - "Start Spotify."
  - "Go to music folder."
  - "Check drive space."
  - "Give me hardware details."
  - "What is the weather in Reykjavik?"
  - "What's my subnet mask?"
  - "Mute the sound"

## Idea

The core idea behind WindowsScript is to transform the traditional interaction paradigm with computers. Currently, performing tasks on a computer often involves a series of steps: searching for how-to guides, navigating through various settings, and adjusting specific options. WindowsScript aims to simplify this process by allowing users to communicate their intentions directly, using natural language. 

For instance, rather than manually muting your computer through a series of clicks, you could simply say "mute sound" or "mute," and WindowsScript would execute the task for you. This approach flips the conventional model of computer use, making the machine adapt to human language rather than requiring humans to interpret and navigate machine-oriented interfaces.
