# README for Plang App

Welcome to the README documentation for our Plang application. This document aims to guide you through the installation, running, and understanding of the application. Whether you're a computer novice or an experienced developer, this README is designed to provide you with all the necessary information to get started with our app.

## Introduction

This application is developed using Plang, a natural language programming language that simplifies the process of coding. It's designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making it accessible for people of all skill levels.

## Before you run

Before you can run the application, you need to have Plang installed on your computer. Plang is a prerequisite for running the app, and if it's not installed, the app won't work. You can find the installation instructions for Plang at the following URL: [Install Plang](https://github.com/PLangHQ/plang/blob/main/Documentation/Install.md). Please follow the instructions carefully to ensure Plang is properly installed on your system.

## How to run

To run the application, you need to navigate to the folder containing the app in your terminal or command prompt. Once you're in the correct folder, execute the following command:

```bash
plang
```

This command will start the application. If you encounter any issues while trying to run the app, please refer to the troubleshooting section below.

## How to build

If the application does not run as expected, you might need to rebuild it. Rebuilding the app can resolve issues related to outdated or corrupted files. To rebuild the application, use the following command:

```bash
plang build
```

This command will compile the application and prepare it for running. After rebuilding, try running the app again using the `plang` command.

## Summary of code

The application's functionality is defined across several `.goal` files, each serving a specific purpose in the application's workflow. Below is a summary of the code based on the provided source code files:

### Start.goal

This file initiates the application by performing the following actions:

- Prompts the user for the path to their app if not already provided.
- Retrieves the content of all `.goal` files in the specified path and concatenates their content.
- Reads specific `.llm` files and loads variables into the system and user contexts.
- Generates the README.md file based on the loaded variables and writes it to the specified path.

### ConcatFileContent

This function is called within `Start.goal` and is responsible for appending the content of each `.goal` file, including its path, to a variable. This helps in aggregating the content of all `.goal` files for processing.

By understanding the flow and functionality defined in these `.goal` files, users can get a clear picture of how the application operates and processes information to generate documentation.
