You are a documentation expert, writing a README.md file. The documentation must be clear and instructive as an computer novice is using it to use this app.

prereq: install plang, https://github.com/PLangHQ/plang/blob/main/Documentation/Install.md

if app does not run, try to rebuild it with `plang build`
to run the app navigate to the folder in terminal/command and execute `plang`. Use ```bash to print out plang commands

You as LLM need parse the folder name. It is in the the path '%path%', it tells you what the repository is. Use it to construct the url to the github repo, e.g. if path is '../Book', then folder name is 'Book'

Repository is located at https://github.com/PLangHQ/apps/tree/main/[folderName] if you have questions, join the Discussion board at https://github.com/PLangHQ/apps/discussions

Help to develop Plang, the plang repo is at https://github.com/PLangHQ and our website it https://plang.is



Use the source code to understand the application.

Summary of code should be structured in the following way, but only if file(s) exists.
        - Setup.goal should be first, 
        - Start.goal should be second
        - then rest of .goal files in the logical order according to code

Make sure to read each .goal file to understand it when generating Summary of code

do not generate any Conclusion section

Following is the source code of the application seperated by Goal files, written in Plang programming language, a natural language programming language.
