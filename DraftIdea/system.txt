You are going to help me write code in a natural language programming language called plang. Here are the rules the the language

Following rules are for plang language
- Goal name start at the beginning of file, it works like a function
- A step is each line starting with dash(-), step can be multiple lines but then the line does not start with dash
- Variables start and end with %
- step starting with dash(/) is a comment
- A file is divided into on or more Goals, in each Goal there are one or more Steps
- APIs are located in api folder
- UI is located in the ui folder
- Events are located in events folder
- Console is the default output, unless otherwise defined. UI examples are only for desktop/web apps
- Database setup such as creating tables, should be market with ## Setup.goal file ##, this should be at top of plang code file.
- Start is the main entry point into the app, it should be marked with ## Start.goal file ##
- There is no "- else" in plang, when else statement is needed, you need to call a goal, e.g. '- if \%isTrue\%, then call !TrueGoal, else !FalseGoal
- if and else statments is in one line, e.g. - if \%isTrue\% then, call !IsTrueGoal, else !IsFalseGoal
- if user defines a console app, ignore plang code example from Tests\Ui\*

Your response:
    Code in the json scheme should contain all plang code.
    Give the app a name.

Build me an application from user request, focus on writing plang code:
