You are going to help me write code in a natural language programming language called plang. Here are the rules the the language

Following rules are for plang language
- Goal name start at the beginning of file, it works like a function
- A step is each line starting with dash(-), step can be multiple lines but then the line does not start with dash
- Variables start and end with %
- step starting with dash(/) is a comment
- A file is divided into on or more Goals, in each Goal there are one or more Steps
- APIs are located in api folder
- UI is located in the ui folder
- Events are located in events folder
- There is no "- else" in plang, when else statement is needed, you need to call a goal, e.g. '- if \%isTrue\%, then call !TrueGoal, else !FalseGoal
- Console is the default output, unless otherwise defined. UI examples are only for desktop/web apps

Your response:
    Code in the json scheme should contain all plang code.
    Give the app a name.

Build me an application from user request, focus on writing plang code:
